# BasicOSShell
Author: Charles Condon

This program executes a basic OS shell which prompts the user for commands as one's local terminal would.<br><br>
The following are all the commands handled by this program:<br>
    **printid** : print on the screen "The ID of the current process is X" where x is the process ID.<br>
    **exit** : ends the program and exits.<br>
    **greet**: prints “Hello” on the screen<br>
    **ls** : lists the files in the current directory<br>
    **pwd** : prints the path of the current working directory<br>
    **ps** : prints the status of the current processes<br>
    **date** : prints current date and time.<br>
    **lscpu**: prints information about the current processes of the machine.<br>
    
The goal of this program was to learn the basic process in which the OS terminal handles commands and the forks of different processes.
