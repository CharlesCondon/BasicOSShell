# BasicOSShell
Author: Charles Condon

This program executes a basic OS shell which prompts the user for commands as one's local terminal would.
The following are all the commands handled by this program:<br>
    printid : print on the screen "The ID of the current process is X" where x is the process ID.
    exit : ends the program and exits.
    greet: prints “Hello” on the screen
    ls : lists the files in the current directory
    pwd : prints the path of the current working directory
    ps : prints the status of the current processes
    date : prints current date and time.
    lscpu: prints information about the current processes of the machine. 
    
The goal of this program was to learn the basic process in which the OS terminal handles commands and the forks of different processes.
